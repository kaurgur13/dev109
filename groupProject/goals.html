        <h2>Purpose of making JustType:</h2>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>A simple and engaging website designed to help developers practice coding 
          while allowing both developers and users to improve their typing speed. 
          Additionally, it fosters collaboration and teamwork skills among developers, 
          making it an effective platform for skill enhancement and cooperative learning.</p>

        <h2>The goals:</h2>
        <div class="answer">
          <h3>Succsfully make a website that work correctly (Done)</h3> 
          <p>The standard goal is to make a website that work correctly 
          to the instructions and the initial idea of our group.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="answer">
          <h3>Count the scores and mistakes correctly (Done)</h3> 
          <p>Initially, the score calculation was incorrect, leading to inaccurate total scores.
            We have since corrected the error, and the scores now display accurately.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="answer">
          <h3>Display the final score in a box that pop up after the timer run out (Not done)</h3> 
          <p>We intended to display the final score in a pop-up box after the timer expired. 
            However, due to time constraints from other assignments and a lack of clear planning,
            we opted for a simple text display showing the total score and number of mistakes.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="answer">
          <h3>Hightlight mistakes (Not done)</h3> 
          <p>Initially, we planned to provide immediate feedback by highlighting the displayed 
            sentence in green for correct input and red for incorrect input, pinpointing user 
            errors. However, due to implementation complexity, we opted for a simpler text box 
            approach without error highlighting, increasing the difficulty.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="answer">
          <h3>Make the code clean (Done)</h3> 
          <p>Recognizing the project's inherent complexity, we prioritized code cleanliness by 
            dividing functionality into small, modular components and adhering to consistent 
            spacing and formatting guidelines to improve readability.</p>
