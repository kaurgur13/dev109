      <h2>How JustType Was Created</h2>
      <p>JustType was developed by our group as a fun and challenging way to improve 
        typing speed and accuracy. We wanted to create a game that encourages users 
        to type quickly while minimizing mistakes. JustType was also a challenge for 
        our team, as it served as a foundational projectâ€”a basic, first-level website 
        that allowed us to test our skills and learn the fundamentals of web development.</p>

      <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
      <h3>Duy Anh Nguyen</h3>
      <p>Duy worked on the html, a bit of css for the base-design, how the website look 
        while helping the other teammates with their parts.</p>

      <h3>Gurkirat Kaur</h3>
      <p>Gurkirat developed the JavaScript functionality for JustType, implementing the typing logic for the game.</p>

      <h3>Buu Quach</h3>
      <p>Buu focused on bringing the website to life through CSS styling. Primarily worked with CSS for layout, colors, and responsiveness. Also made small HTML adjustments to enhance the structure and improve the overall look and feel of the site.</p>

      <h2>Why We Built This Project</h2>
      <p>Our team wanted to create a project that was both educational and entertaining.
        We saw the need for a simple, engaging typing game and decided to bring our 
        ideas together to develop JustType.</p>
